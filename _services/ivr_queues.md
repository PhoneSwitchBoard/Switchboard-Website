Calls made to your company's telephone lines will be answered by the IVR, an automated telephone system that connects with **Switchboard Cloud** and gives callers options, by playing pre-recorded voice messages, to choose through the tone keypad, where their call should be routed to be answered by a specific department or agent.


## Queues

In **Switchboard Cloud** you can have different Queues for your calling contacts to be routed to. This way you can separate calls intended for User Support, for example, from Sales calls.


> To add yourself, the Agent who logged in, to one of the existing queues, you can use the `Add to Queue` option in the left menu.

Additionally, you can add other agents to queues from the `Add to Queue` button, located to the right of the agent name in the agent list.

Note that an Agent can be _Paused_ or _Active_ in a queue, and you can manage it from the list of queues in the dashboard.
