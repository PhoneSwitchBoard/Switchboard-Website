## Integrations


1. **Phone Service Provider:** As you might assume, we need to integrate a phone service provider, who will be responsible for handling incoming and outgoing calls from your **Switchboard Cloud** phone application. The main providers that offer these services are: [Twilio](./../../docs/startcloud/twilio), Flowroute, Lingo Telecom, and others. You only need to integrate one of them for your Phone System to operate normally.


2. **Import your Contacts**: Your [Microsoft 365](./../../docs/startcloud/microsoft) account will be used for the purpose of importing your contact list from it. However, there will be options in the phone application available to create contacts from there.
