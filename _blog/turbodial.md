**TurboDial** is the voice companion for **Keap**. It uses **Twilio** to connect the calls and send/receive text messages. **TurboDial** does not recommend to operate this product independently from **Keap**.

> This article explores the main complaints users often encounter with **Keap** (formerly **Infusionsoft**), and **TurboDial**.

### Complexity and Steep Learning Curve

**TurboDial**, which integrates with **Keap** for enhanced communication and sales automation, presents a learning curve. Users may find it challenging to set up and integrate with their existing systems. The complexity can lead to frustration, particularly for small businesses or solo entrepreneurs who may not have dedicated technical support.

### Cost and Pricing Structure

Another common complaint is the cost associated with using these platforms. **Keap** is considered a premium tool with pricing tiers that can quickly escalate as businesses grow or require more features. Users often feel that the pricing structure is not transparent or flexible enough, leading to unexpected costs. The lack of a clear pricing model can lead to misunderstandings about the total cost.

### Integration and Compatibility Issues

Integration with other tools and platforms is a critical aspect of any automation or CRM software. However, users often report difficulties in integrating **Keap** with other software, especially niche or less common tools. This lack of seamless integration can hinder workflow efficiency and result in duplicated efforts or data discrepancies.

While **TurboDial** is designed to work with **Keap**, users sometimes encounter compatibility issues, particularly when trying to use it alongside other communication tools or CRMs. This can lead to disruptions in workflow and frustration, as users must find workarounds or settle for less-than-ideal integrations.

### Customer Support and Service

Customer support quality is a frequently cited concern. Users often report long response times and difficulty in obtaining comprehensive assistance, especially with more complex issues. While **Keap** does offer support, the level of service can vary, and some users feel that the support provided does not match the high cost of the platform.

Similarly, **TurboDial** users may find that support resources are limited, particularly if they encounter technical issues or require assistance with advanced features. The availability of timely and knowledgeable support is crucial, and any shortcomings in this area can lead to user dissatisfaction.

### Customization and Flexibility

While **Keap** offer a wide range of features, users sometimes find them lacking in flexibility. The platform may not fully accommodate unique business processes or specific industry needs, especially in terms of reporting, workflow automation, and interface design.

## Conclusion

While **Keap** and **TurboDial** offer robust solutions for CRM needs, they are not without their challenges. The complexity, cost, integration issues, customer support, and limited customization are common complaints among users. Businesses considering these tools should carefully evaluate their specific needs, budget, and technical capabilities to ensure they select the right solutions and prepare adequately for the associated learning curves and costs.
